# AnF shared handoff

Every assistant (Claude, Gemini/Antigravity, Codex, others) MUST read this file before starting work and update it before stopping. Keep entries short and dated. Workers report the final release (download links, platforms, exact version) back to the primary AnF conversation; a worker's own chat is not enough.

Last updated: 2026-11-01 by Claude (session https://claude.ai/code/session_01DHgVzsPDP7PNt8MKD8CHFa), after `main` reached `52ba24d`.

## Status of every line of work

| Line | Where | Version | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub `main` | github.com/mwalikokelvo/AnF `main` (52ba24d) | 0.1.47 | Source of truth. Contains the v0.1.47 merge (PR #51), security hardening (#52) and packaging hardening (#53). The macOS app keeps its own version (0.1.4). |
| Superpowers skills | `claude/superpowers-skills` (PR #49, open) | n/a | Shared skills in `.agents/skills/`. Open, not merged. |
| Open stale PRs | #8 dependabot `sha2`; #2 `codex/downloadable-releases` | n/a | See the triage section below. |
| User's local copy | user's PC | 0.1.21 | Older than main; not authoritative. |

Nothing is released. No GitHub release was published; build workflows only produce review artifacts.

## What PRs #48-#53 did (all merged except #49)

- #48: MKR Music lyrics provider and multi-LLM reconcile (Gemini/Antigravity line).
- #49: Superpowers skills v7.0.1 for all assistants. Still open.
- #50: v0.1.47 integration branch (Antigravity wip snapshot) plus the first shared HANDOFF.md.
- #51: merged v0.1.47 into `main` (domain reorg of `windows/src/workspace/*`, removal of stale duplicate domain directories and superseded scripts, single-pass HTML tag scanner in the ZIM reader).
- #52: security hardening for v0.1.47 (OCR, CSP, themes, opt-in lookups, local AI labels).
- #53: hardened `scripts/package-release.py` and corrected `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Verification state of 0.1.47

Labels: tested = executed and passed; compiled = built only; installed = run on a real device.

Verified (Linux container and GitHub CI):
- `npx tsc --noEmit` in `windows/`: passes.
- Unit tests: 144 of 147 pass (3 not passing; see open items).
- E2E (`windows/scripts/test-e2e.mjs`): 138 pass, 0 fail.
- `node scripts/check-release.mjs`: 11 release regression checks pass.
- CI Linux and Windows builds, including Rust tests, are green (compiled and tested in CI).
- Android CI run 41277276482 built the unsigned and debug APKs (compiled only; the release APK is unsigned).

NOT verified:
- Nobody has installed or launched the Windows installer, the portable build or either Android APK. No installed verification exists for 0.1.47 on any platform.
- The Windows review build files were delivered in chat only, not through a release or this repository: setup sha256 `639a4d19...`, portable `075e8f27...` (prefixes only; take the full sums from the original delivery). They were built from the tree BEFORE the #52/#53 fixes, so they do not correspond to current `main`. Treat them as a review build, not a verified release.
- No Android 16 KB alignment result, signed APK or sums have been recorded here for current `main`.

## Stale branch and PR triage (against `main` 52ba24d, 2026-11-01)

"Ahead/behind" is commits not in main / commits main has that the branch lacks. No branch was deleted or changed.

| Branch / PR | Ahead / behind | Unique content left | Already in main? | Merge conflicts with main | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `claude/companion` | 13 / 201 | Opt-in desktop companion commit (`ff41f5e`) and Spotube Android CI diagnostics (heap, annotation text). | `windows/src-tauri/src/companion.rs`, `windows/src/companion/*` exist on main in a different (later) form; CI diagnostics are superseded by the current workflows. | Yes, 17 files. | Close. Nothing to cherry-pick unless the companion regresses; compare against main's `companion.rs` first. |
| `claude/marketplace` | 12 / 201 | Opt-in theme marketplace (`074426a`), `addons.ts` additions, same CI commits. | `marketplace/` (themes, `registry.json`) and `addons.rs` are on main. | Yes, 20 files. | Close. |
| `claude/sync-main-2` | 14 / 199 | Merge of main into the CI fix branch, review build of marketplace + companion (#7, "do not merge"). | Same content as the two branches above. | Yes, 35 files. | Close. It is a review-build carrier, not a feature branch. |
| `codex/marketplace-vault-recovery-2026-10-25` | 1 / 199 | `windows/src/workspace/marketplace.ts` and `addon-data.ts`, `addon-sandbox.html`, `marketplace/SETUP.txt`, `windows/dev/marketplace-check.mjs`, vault v1 fixture (`contracts/fixtures/vault-v1-fixture.db`, `contracts/tools/vault-fixture` changes), `docs/AF-Marketplace-Vault-Checkpoint-2026-10-25.md`. | No: `marketplace.ts` and the vault fixture db are absent from main. `addons.rs` exists on main separately. | Yes, 13 files (add/add in `addons.rs`). | Keep. Cherry-pick the vault fixture and `contracts/tools/vault-fixture` update first (self-contained); decide separately on the isolated marketplace UI, which conflicts with main's `addons.rs`/`lib.rs`. |
| `codex/windows-release-verify` | 6 / 289 | Windows/Android/Linux/macOS reproducible release build prep, FFmpeg pin, Linux runner disk space, PDF bytes on Windows. | All 6 commits are patch-equivalent to commits already on main. | Yes, 42 files (very old base). | Close. |
| `integration/preserve-v0141-pr47` | 0 / 99 | None. | Fully contained in main (0 commits ahead). | None. | Close (or keep only as a historical pointer). |
| PR #2 `codex/downloadable-releases` | 67 / 289 | 36 commits not patch-equivalent to main: Android music preview isolation and host lifecycle (`002ca93`), ARM64 16 KB alignment verification, local speech worker isolation, OmniRoute lifecycle (0.1.32 snapshot), specialist protocol docs, app-QA scripts. | 31 commits are patch-equivalent to main. | Yes, 266 files (330 files changed). | Do not merge as is. Cherry-pick selectively if the Android music preview or speech worker work is wanted; otherwise close the PR. Last updated 2026-10-25. |
| PR #8 dependabot `sha2` 0.10 to 0.11 | 1 / 198 | One-line `crates/anf-vault/Cargo.toml` bump. | No. | None (but the code does not compile; see below). | Do not merge as is. Needs the follow-up below, or close and let dependabot reopen. |

PR #8 needs, verified by building `crates/anf-vault` on the PR branch with `cargo update -p sha2` (sha2 0.11.1 resolved):
- `cargo update -p sha2` inside `crates/anf-vault` (the branch predates the committed `Cargo.lock`; main's lock pins 0.10.9, so the lock must change too).
- Code change: `crates/anf-vault/src/lib.rs` lines 116 and 130 use `format!("{:x}", Sha256::digest(..))`. In sha2 0.11 the digest output (`Array<u8, _>`) no longer implements `LowerHex`, so the crate fails to compile with two E0277 errors. Replace with explicit hex encoding (for example `.iter().map(|b| format!("{b:02x}")).collect::<String>()`, or the `hex` crate). The output must stay byte-identical because it feeds revisions and conflict ids; add a test against known values from the vault fixture.
- Other `sha2 = "0.10"` users are separate and unaffected unless bumped too: `_core/Cargo.toml`, `windows/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `contracts/tools/vault-fixture/Cargo.toml` (0.10.8). Keep versions consistent or accept two sha2 versions in the tree.

Other remote branches not triaged (all recent or backups, left alone): `backup/antigravity-*`, `base51`, `claude/anf-v0147-integration`, `merge/v0.1.47-into-main`, `fix/security-v0147`, `codex/af-checkpoint-2026-10-24`, `codex/android-music-preview-0.1.21`, `codex/app-downloads-0.1.19`/`0.1.20`, `release/0.1.22`, `feat/mkr-music-integration`. Several are now merged into main and are candidates for deletion by the user.

## Continuation checkpoints

`continuations/af-0.2.0-2026-10-24/` holds the AF checkpoints (Project handoff 2026-10-23, then checkpoints through 2026-10-24). The newest are the 2026-10-24 files, with `AF-GitHub-Continuation-2026-10-24.md` as the latest GitHub continuation record and `AF-Windows-Native-Checkpoint-2026-10-24.md`, `AF-Writing-Controls-Checkpoint-2026-10-24.md`, `AF-Writing-Lock-Checkpoint-2026-10-24.md` among the last. They predate v0.1.47 by about a week and describe the AF 0.2.0 line; read them for background, but this file and `main` are authoritative.

## How to build, test, release

- Windows/Linux (Tauri): `cd windows && npm ci && npm test && npm run test:e2e && npm run tauri dev`. Release pack on Windows x64 only: `./scripts/prepare-offline.ps1; ./scripts/prepare-media.ps1; npm run pack`. See `docs/RELEASE-BUILDS.md`.
- Release gate checks: `node scripts/check-release.mjs`. Android APK checks: `scripts/check-android-apk.py`.
- Android: `node scripts/build-android.mjs` (JDK 21, Gradle 9.4.1, Android SDK platform 37.0, build-tools 36.0.0, target SDK 35, package `com.coucou.workspace`). Version comes from `windows/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`; versionCode is derived from it. Check 16 KB alignment with `zipalign -c -P 16 4 <apk>` and publish SHA-256 sums. The release APK stays unsigned unless the original signing key is available; never commit or publish the key. See `android/RELEASE-PROCEDURE.txt`.
- macOS: `cd NotchBuddy && xcodegen && xcodebuild -scheme NotchBuddy -configuration Debug build`. Never edit the `.xcodeproj` by hand.
- Keep versions in sync across `tauri.conf.json`, Cargo and frontend `package.json`.
- CI: check results through the REST API (`gh api repos/mwalikokelvo/AnF/...`); GraphQL is unavailable from Claude Code sessions. Build workflows produce review artifacts only; they do not publish a GitHub release.

## Rules (from CLAUDE.md)

- Never restyle shipped UI (pills, cards, Settings, chat). Existing views stay as in `main` unless explicitly asked. New views follow the existing style.
- Pill IDs are stable contract values; never rename one. Keep the bundle identifier `fr.louisraille.NotchBuddy` and legacy storage/cryptographic names.
- Secrets in the Keychain only. No telemetry. Network only to services the user configured.
- Never block Claude Code (hook exits immediately if the app does not answer). Never overwrite `~/.claude/settings.json` without dated backup, diff and confirmation. Never send an email or approve a permission without an explicit click.
- Swift 6, SwiftUI + AppKit, no third-party dependencies unless unavoidable. 0 percent CPU when the island is hidden.
- Default style is Ponytail: smallest complete change, reuse first, never skip validation, security or tests for non-trivial logic.
- Release reports lead with usable download links and accurate platform/version labels. Distinguish installed verification from compilation and browser fixtures. Do not call a review build a verified functioning release.
- Never force-push, never merge to `main` without the user.
- Check installed skills before specialized work; keep them current with `skills update -g`.

## Open items

1. Install and launch verification: nobody has run the Windows installer/portable build or either Android APK for 0.1.47. Build from current `main` (after #52/#53), install on a real Windows machine and an Android device, and record the result, full SHA-256 sums and download links here.
2. Rebuild the Windows review files from current `main`; the delivered setup (`639a4d19...`) and portable (`075e8f27...`) predate the fixes.
3. Android: the release APK is unsigned; signing needs the owner's key via the repository secrets described in `docs/RELEASE-BUILDS.md`. Run the 16 KB alignment check (`zipalign -c -P 16 4`) on the APKs from run 41277276482 or a newer run.
4. Find and fix or document the 3 of 147 unit tests that do not pass.
5. PR #49 (Superpowers skills): review and decide.
6. PR #8: apply the sha2 0.11 changes above or close it. PR #2: close or cherry-pick.
7. Salvage from `codex/marketplace-vault-recovery-2026-10-25` (vault fixture first), then the user may delete the stale branches listed in the triage table.
8. When a release is chosen, workers report links, platforms and exact version to the primary AnF conversation and update this file.
